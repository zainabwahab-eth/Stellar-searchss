# Contributing to StellarSearch

Thank you for taking the time to contribute! StellarSearch is an open-source, pay-per-query web search API built on the Stellar blockchain using the x402 payment protocol. Every improvement — from a one-line typo fix to a full feature implementation — is welcome.

This document covers everything you need to go from zero to a merged pull request.

## ⚡ First 15 minutes

Want to see the app running and change something you can look at? Follow this section only — it is the shortest path from clone to a visible change. **No wallet, no testnet account, no blockchain knowledge required.**

Everything after this section is reference material for when you need it.

### 1. Clone and install (~4 min)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Stellar-Search.git
cd Stellar-Search
npm install          # Node 18+ and npm 9+ required
```

### 2. Add two free API keys (~4 min)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and set **only these two** values:

| Key | Where to get it | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| `SERPER_API_KEY` | [serper.dev](https://serper.dev) | Free — 2,500 queries/month |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | [console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys) | Free |

Leave every other value in `.env` exactly as it is. `STELLAR_RECEIVING_ADDRESS` can stay as the placeholder and the server will still boot — it only matters for the paid `/search` route (see step 5).

### 3. Run it (~2 min)

```bash
npm run dev:all      # starts the Express backend (:3001) and Vite frontend (:5173)
```

Open **http://localhost:5173**. You should see the landing page, navbar, footer and the stats grid. The floating Groq assistant works too, because it only needs `GROQ_API_KEY`.

> Prefer two terminals? Run `npm run server` and `npm run dev` side by side. (`npm run setup` does steps 1 and 2 for you if you would rather run one command.)

### 4. Make a visible change (~3 min)

Pick any file under `src/` and edit it — Vite hot-reloads instantly, so you get feedback in the browser without restarting anything.

```
src/components/layout/Footer.tsx   # change the tagline text
src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx   # tweak a link label or spacing
src/pages/DocsPage.tsx             # fix wording in the docs copy
```

That is a real, PR-able contribution. Confirm it still typechecks before opening a PR:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### 5. What you can (and cannot) do without a wallet

| ✅ Works with no wallet | ⛔ Needs Freighter + funded testnet USDC |
|---|---|
| Everything in `src/` — pages, components, hooks, styling, copy, layout | `/search` (the 0.001 USDC paid route) and anything that calls it |
| `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npx tsc --noEmit` | `src/hooks/useSearch.ts`, `src/hooks/useFreighterWallet.ts`, `src/components/wallet/WalletPanel.tsx` |
| `GET /health` and `GET /ai/chat` on the backend | `src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` (reads live Horizon tx history) |
| Docs, README, CONTRIBUTING, issue triage, tests | `npm run test:search`, MCP payment tools |

If your change never touches the payment flow, you never need to install Freighter or create a Stellar account. The full wallet walkthrough is in [Local Development Setup](#local-development-setup).

### 6. Find something to work on

- **[Good first issues](https://github.com/Emmy123222/Stellar-Search/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)** — scoped, self-contained, with clear acceptance criteria.
- [All open issues](https://github.com/Emmy123222/Stellar-Search/issues) — the backlog has 50+ scoped ideas.
- Comment _"I'd like to work on this"_ on the issue before you start, so two people do not build the same thing.

Then branch, commit and open a PR — the conventions are in [Development Workflow](#development-workflow) and [Submitting a Pull Request](#submitting-a-pull-request).

    │
    ▼
Serper.dev  ──── real Google results ────►  Browser
```

**Core packages:**

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `@x402/express` | HTTP 402 payment middleware |
| `@x402/stellar` | Stellar-specific x402 scheme |
| `@x402/fetch` | Client-side x402 fetch wrapper |
| `@stellar/freighter-api` | Browser wallet signing |
| `@stellar/stellar-sdk` | Horizon API client |
| `groq-sdk` | Groq AI (Llama 3.3 70B) |
| `serper.dev` | Real-time Google search results |

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Node.js** | ≥ 18.0.0 | ESM support required |
| **npm** | ≥ 9.0.0 | Comes with Node 18 |
| **Git** | any recent | — |
| **Freighter** | latest | [freighter.app](https://freighter.app) browser extension |
| **Stellar testnet account** | — | Free — see setup below |

### Free API keys you will need

| Key | Where to get it | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| `SERPER_API_KEY` | [serper.dev](https://serper.dev) | Free — 2,500 queries/month |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | [console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys) | Free |
| `STELLAR_RECEIVING_ADDRESS` | [Stellar Lab](https://lab.stellar.org/account/fund) | Free testnet keypair |

> **Note:** You only need `SERPER_API_KEY` and `GROQ_API_KEY` for most frontend work. The `STELLAR_RECEIVING_ADDRESS` is only required if you are working on the payment flow.

---

## Local Development Setup

### 1. Fork and clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub first, then clone it:
git clone https://github.com/StellarAgent-AI-Agent-Payment-Rails/Stellar-searchss.git
cd Stellar-searchss
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in your values:

```env
# Required for search to work
SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key_here
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_groq_key_here

# Required for x402 payment flow (official x402.org facilitator — no facilitator API key required)
STELLAR_RECEIVING_ADDRESS=GXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
STELLAR_NETWORK=stellar:testnet
VITE_STELLAR_NETWORK=stellar:testnet
FACILITATOR_URL=https://www.x402.org/facilitator

# Server
PORT=3001

# Frontend — points the React app at your local backend
VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### 4. Set up Freighter (for payment flow work)

1. Install [Freighter](https://freighter.app) browser extension.
2. Create a new wallet (or import one).
3. Switch to **Testnet**: Settings → Network → Testnet.
4. Get a funded testnet account at [Stellar Lab](https://lab.stellar.org/account/fund).
5. Add the USDC trustline and claim testnet USDC from the [Circle faucet](https://faucet.circle.com) — the full walkthrough is the [Get testnet USDC](README.md#get-testnet-usdc) section of the README.

> If you are **not** working on the wallet or payment flow, you can skip step 4 entirely — the frontend works without a wallet for most UI changes.

### 5. Start the development servers

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Express backend (port 3001)
npm run server

# Terminal 2 — Vite frontend (port 5173)
npm run dev
```

Both can also be started together with:

```bash
npm run dev:all
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

### 6. Verify everything works

```bash
# Health check — should return { "status": "ok", ... }
curl http://localhost:3001/health | jq .

# Optional: end-to-end payment test (requires .env with all keys set)
npm run test:search "Stellar blockchain"
```

### Key boundaries to understand

- **`src/`** — runs in the browser. Never put secrets here. Env vars must be prefixed `VITE_`.
- **`server/`** — runs in Node.js. Holds all API keys. Never import server-only code from `src/`.
- **`api/`** — Vercel serverless functions. These mirror `server/index.ts` routes for production deployment.
- **`mcp-server/`** — MCP server for Claude Code integration. Runs as a separate process.

---

## Development Workflow

### Pick an issue

Browse [open issues](https://github.com/StellarAgent-AI-Agent-Payment-Rails/Stellar-searchss/issues). Issues labelled **good first issue** are specifically chosen for first-time contributors — they are scoped, self-contained, and have clear acceptance criteria.

Comment on the issue before you start: _"I'd like to work on this"_ — this avoids duplicate effort.

### Create a branch

Branch off `main` using this naming convention:

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Bug fix | `fix/<short-description>` | `fix/freighter-rejection-loop` |
| New feature | `feat/<short-description>` | `feat/search-history` |
| Documentation | `docs/<short-description>` | `docs/contributing-guide` |
| Refactor | `refactor/<short-description>` | `refactor/memoize-stats-grid` |
| Test | `test/<short-description>` | `test/use-search-unit` |
| Chore/DX | `chore/<short-description>` | `chore/add-eslint` |

```bash
git checkout -b fix/freighter-rejection-loop
```

### Make your changes

- Keep changes focused — one concern per PR.
- Follow the [coding standards](#coding-standards) below.
- Run the typecheck frequently: `npx tsc --noEmit`.

### Commit messages

Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

[optional body]

[optional footer — e.g. Closes #12]
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

**Examples:**

```
fix(wallet): catch Freighter rejection and set session to error state

Closes #1
```

```
feat(search): add localStorage search history with 20-entry limit

Stores { query, timestamp, txHash } entries.
Closes #9
```

```
docs: add CONTRIBUTING.md
```

---

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin fix/freighter-rejection-loop
   ```

2. Open a PR against `main` on GitHub.

3. Fill in the PR template:
   - **What does this PR do?** — one paragraph summary.
   - **Which issue does it close?** — link with `Closes #N`.
   - **How was it tested?** — steps you took to verify locally.
   - **Screenshots** — required for any UI change.

4. Make sure:
   - [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with no errors.
   - [ ] The app starts and the affected feature works manually.
   - [ ] No new `console.log` / debug statements left in.
   - [ ] No secrets or `.env` values committed.

5. A maintainer will review your PR. Please respond to review comments within a reasonable time. If you need more time, just say so — the PR won't be closed.

### PR size guidelines

| Change type | Ideal PR size |
|---|---|
| Bug fix | < 100 lines changed |
| Small feature | < 300 lines changed |
| Large feature | Break into logical sub-PRs |
| Refactor | One file / one abstraction at a time |

---

## Issue Guidelines

### Reporting a bug

Before opening a new issue:

1. Search existing issues — it may already be reported.
2. Try reproducing on the latest `main` branch.
3. Check [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for known x402/Freighter issues.

When you open a bug, include:

- **Steps to reproduce** — numbered, minimal.
- **Expected behaviour** vs **actual behaviour**.
- **Environment:** OS, browser, Node version, Freighter version.
- **Console output / error messages** — paste the full stack trace.
- **Network tab screenshot** (for payment flow issues).

### Requesting a feature

- Explain the **problem** you are solving, not just the solution you have in mind.
- If the feature involves the payment flow or blockchain state, describe how edge cases (network error, wallet rejection, insufficient balance) should behave.
- Check the [open issues](https://github.com/StellarAgent-AI-Agent-Payment-Rails/Stellar-searchss/issues) first — the backlog already has 50+ scoped ideas waiting for contributors.

---

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- **Strict mode is on** — `"strict": true` in `tsconfig.json`. Do not use `any` unless absolutely necessary and document why.
- Prefer `interface` for object shapes, `type` for unions and mapped types.
- Export types from `src/types/index.ts` if they are used across more than one file.
- No implicit `any` — always type function parameters and return values.

### React

- Functional components only — no class components.
- Co-locate state close to where it is used. Lift only when required.
- Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` when passing callbacks to memoized children or in hook internals, not by default everywhere.
- Clean up side effects in `useEffect` — cancel timers, abort fetch, remove listeners.
- Component files export one default component. Helpers live in the same file or a co-located `utils.ts`.

### Styling

- **Tailwind CSS only** — no inline `style={{}}` props and no external CSS files (except `src/index.css` for global resets).
- Use responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) for layout breakpoints.
- Animations use Framer Motion — do not add new animation libraries.
- Do not hardcode colour hex values — use Tailwind's colour palette.

### File and folder conventions

- File names: `PascalCase` for components (`SearchBar.tsx`), `camelCase` for hooks and utilities (`useSearch.ts`, `stellar.ts`).
- Each `components/<area>/` folder has an `index.ts` barrel export.
- Hooks live in `src/hooks/`. A hook file exports exactly one hook as its named export.

### Comments

Only write a comment when the **why** is non-obvious — a hidden constraint, a Stellar SDK quirk, or a workaround for a specific bug. Do not comment what the code does; well-named identifiers do that. Do not leave `TODO:` comments in PRs — open an issue instead.

Significant architecture decisions are recorded as [Architecture Decision Records](./docs/adr/README.md) in `docs/adr/`. If your change reverses or revises one of those decisions, update the relevant ADR (or write a new one that supersedes it).

```ts
// Freighter returns a Buffer, not a string — must convert to base64 explicitly.
// Using .toString() gives "[object Buffer]" (9 chars) causing x402 signature length error.
const signedAuthEntry = Buffer.from(raw as unknown as Uint8Array).toString('base64')
```

### Environment variables

- Never commit real secrets. `.env` is in `.gitignore` — keep it that way.
- Frontend env vars must be prefixed `VITE_` to be exposed to the browser by Vite.
- Server env vars go in `.env` and are read via `process.env`. Never import them in `src/`.
- When adding a new env var, add it to `.env.example` with a descriptive comment and a placeholder value.

---

## Testing

The frontend uses Vitest, React Testing Library, and jsdom for component tests. See the open [testing issues](https://github.com/StellarAgent-AI-Agent-Payment-Rails/Stellar-searchss/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Atesting) for areas that still need coverage. If you add a hook, component, or server route, include focused tests where practical.

### Component-test conventions

- Put tests next to the component as `<Component>.test.tsx`.
- Render with React Testing Library and query by accessible role or label before using test IDs.
- Test user-visible behavior (including guards and empty/loading states), not implementation details.
- Mock network, wallet, and toast boundaries; do not make payment calls from unit tests.
- Run `npm test` for a one-shot Vitest run or `npm run test:watch` while developing.

### Manual testing checklist

For any change to the search or payment flow, verify:

- [ ] Wallet disconnected → search is blocked with a clear message.
- [ ] Freighter not installed → error message shown, no crash.
- [ ] Freighter on wrong network (Public) → blocked with instructions.
- [ ] USDC balance = 0 → clear message shown.
- [ ] User rejects Freighter popup → session set to `error`, UI recovers.
- [ ] Successful search → results shown, txHash displayed, balance updated.

For UI changes:

- [ ] Test at 375px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1280px (desktop) widths.
- [ ] No horizontal scroll at any breakpoint.
- [ ] Light and dark mode look acceptable (if theme toggle exists).

### Running the TypeScript compiler

```bash
# Check all TypeScript errors (does not emit files)
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### End-to-end test script

```bash
# Requires all .env keys to be set and server running
npm run test:search "Stellar blockchain"
```

## Common Pitfalls

### x402 / Freighter

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| "expected 64 got 9" | `Buffer.toString()` used instead of base64 | Use `Buffer.from(raw).toString('base64')` |
| 402 loop never resolves | Freighter on wrong network | Switch to Testnet in Freighter settings |
| "Failed to parse payment requirements" | Server returning malformed header | Check server logs; decode the `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header with `base64 -d \| jq .` |
| Freighter popup never appears | `createPaymentPayload()` not awaited | Ensure `await` before the call |
| Balance not updating after payment | `refresh()` not called post-search | Call `refresh()` in the `useSearch` success path |

### Vite / Build

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `global is not defined` | Stellar SDK needs `globalThis` polyfill | Already handled in `vite.config.ts` — do not remove the `define` block |
| Buffer errors in browser | `buffer` package not aliased | `resolve.alias` in `vite.config.ts` handles this |
| CORS errors in dev | Frontend calling server directly | Use the Vite proxy (`/search`, `/ai`, `/health` already proxied) |

### Stellar / Horizon

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Account not found | Account not funded on testnet | Fund it at Stellar Lab |
| USDC balance always 0 | Wrong USDC issuer address | Use `GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5` for testnet |
| Transactions not loading | Horizon rate-limit | Add a 500ms delay between calls; use pagination |

---

## Changelog & Releases

Every notable change to StellarSearch is recorded in [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md), which follows the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format and adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

### When to update the changelog

If your PR changes behaviour that a deployer or user would care about, add an entry under the `## [Unreleased]` section of `CHANGELOG.md` in the same PR. Use the appropriate subsection:

| Subsection | Use for |
|---|---|
| `Added` | New features, new env vars, new endpoints |
| `Changed` | Behaviour changes to existing features |
| `Deprecated` | Features that will be removed in a future release |
| `Removed` | Features removed in this release |
| `Fixed` | Bug fixes |
| `Security` | Vulnerability fixes |

Docs-only, test-only, and internal refactor PRs do not require a changelog entry.

### Release process

Maintainers cut releases as follows:

1. Move entries from `## [Unreleased]` into a new `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section.
2. Update the comparison links at the bottom of `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Bump the version in `package.json` to match.
4. Tag the commit (`git tag vX.Y.Z`) and push the tag.
5. Publish the GitHub Release using the new changelog section as the release notes.

### Automating from conventional commits

Because all commits follow [Conventional Commits](#commit-messages), the changelog can be generated automatically. A future PR will wire up a tool such as [`git-cliff`](https://git-cliff.org) or [`conventional-changelog`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) to produce entries from commit history. Until then, update `CHANGELOG.md` by hand — the commit types (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, etc.) map directly onto the changelog subsections above.
