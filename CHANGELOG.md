# Changelog

All notable changes to StellarSearch are documented here.

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Releases are tagged `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` on the `main` branch and a GitHub
Release with these notes is created automatically by the release workflow.

## What constitutes a breaking change?

A **breaking change** (major version bump) is anything that requires callers to
update their integration:

- Removing or renaming an existing endpoint (`GET /search`, `GET /images`,
  `GET /news`, `POST /ai/chat`, `GET /health`).
- Removing or renaming a field in a JSON response body that was previously
  documented as stable.
- Changing the payment amount or currency accepted by the x402 middleware.
- Changing the required request parameters of any endpoint.
- Dropping support for a previously supported x402 scheme or network.

A **minor change** adds new endpoints, new optional response fields, or new
optional request parameters without altering existing behaviour.

A **patch change** is a bug fix, security patch, documentation update, or
internal refactor that does not affect the public API surface.

## MCP Server versioning

The MCP server (`mcp-server/`) is part of the same npm package and shares the
version number defined in `package.json`. It does **not** version independently.
If a future need arises to decouple it (e.g., publishing it as a separate
package), that decision will be noted here and a new section added.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-09-30

### Added

- **Semantic versioning & release process** (resolves [#156](../../issues/156))
  - `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) documents all notable changes going forward.
  - `.github/workflows/release.yml` — push a `v*` tag to trigger an automatic
    GitHub Release with generated notes.
  - `GET /health` and `GET /` now return a `version` field so the running API
    version is always discoverable without inspecting source code.
  - `GET /health` (Vercel / `api/health.ts`) also returns `version`.
  - The UI footer displays the current version sourced from `package.json` via
    the Vite `define` build config.
  - MCP server version updated to match `package.json`.
